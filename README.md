# Simple C++ Deep Learning Framework

This is the code for a simple neural network framework, written from scratch in C++. To use it in C++ projects, simply download the contents of the _Header Files_ folder and include _"deeplframework.hpp"_ in your project.

This framework is able to train multilayer perceptron networks using the MSE (Mean square error) cost function. The plan is to include support for more types of neural networks and more cost functions.

**The framework is partially based from this book:**
